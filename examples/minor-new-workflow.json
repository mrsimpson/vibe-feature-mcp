What's the workflow concept?**\n- What would you call this new workflow?\n- What development scenario or use case should it address?\n- What gap does it fill that the existing 4 workflows don't cover?\n\n**2. What's the intended flow?**\n- How many phases should it have?\n- What should each phase focus on?\n- Should it be linear or allow for iteration between phases?\n\n**3. Any specific characteristics?**\n- Should it be more collaborative, research-focused, experimental, or something else?\n- Any particular development methodology it should follow?\n\nFor example, some workflow ideas that might be useful:\n- **Research workflow**: For spike/proof-of-concept work\n- **Refactoring workflow**: For code improvement without new features  \n- **Documentation workflow**: For documentation-focused tasks\n- **Integration workflow**: For connecting systems or APIs\n- **Performance workflow**: For optimization and performance improvements\n\nWhat kind of workflow did you have in mind?"

What's the workflow concept?**\n- What would you call this new workflow?\n- What development scenario or use case should it address?\n- What gap does it fill that the existing 4 workflows don't cover?\n\n**2.

Any specific characteristics?**\n- Should it be more collaborative, research-focused, experimental, or something else?\n- Any particular development methodology it should follow?\n\nFor example, some workflow ideas that might be useful:\n- **Research workflow**: For spike/proof-of-concept work\n- **Refactoring workflow**: For code improvement without new features  \n- **Documentation workflow**: For documentation-focused tasks\n- **Integration workflow**: For connecting systems or APIs\n- **Performance workflow**: For optimization and performance improvements\n\nWhat kind of workflow did you have in mind?\n[Tool uses: none]",

Let me provide a summary of what we've accomplished:\n\n## ✅ Greenfield Workflow Implementation Complete!\n\nI've successfully implemented the new **greenfield workflow** for the responsible-vibe-mcp server. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### 🎯 **What We Built**\nA comprehensive 5-phase workflow for starting new projects from scratch:\n\n1. **Ideation Phase** - Deep requirements discovery and PRD creation\n   - Extensive questioning about needs, scope, target audience\n   - Exploration of existing solutions and alternatives\n   - Deliverable: Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\n2. **Architecture Phase** - Tech stack selection and architecture design\n   - Technical preference discussions and challenges\n   - Evaluation of alternatives and pros/cons analysis\n   - Non-functional requirements consideration\n   - Deliverable: Architecture Document\n\n3. **Plan Phase** - Implementation planning (reuses epcc approach)\n   - Detailed task breakdown based on architecture\n   - Dependency and risk analysis\n   - Deliverable: Implementation Plan\n\n4. **Code Phase** - Development implementation (reuses epcc approach)\n   - Clean, structured code following architectural decisions\n   - Testing and quality assurance\n   - Deliverable: Working Code\n\n5. **Document Phase** - Comprehensive project documentation\n   - Beginner-friendly README creation\n   - Setup instructions and usage examples\n   - Deliverable: Comprehensive README\n\n### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**\n- **Created** `/resources/workflows/greenfield.yaml` with comprehensive workflow definition\n- **Implemented** all phase transitions with proper instructions and reasoning\n- **Tested** workflow loading and integration (all 96 tests pass)\n- **Updated** README.md documentation in two locations\n- **Committed** with conventional commit message for version bumping\n\n### 🚀 **Ready to Use**\nThe greenfield workflow is now available alongside the existing workflows:\n- `waterfall` - Classical development process\n- `epcc` - Iterative development workflow  \n- `bugfix` - Focused problem-solving workflow\n- `minor-enhancement` - Streamlined changes workflow\n- **`greenfield`** - **NEW!** Comprehensive greenfield project workflow\n- `custom` - User-defined workflows\n\n### 📝 **Usage**\nUsers can now start greenfield projects with:\n```javascript\nstart_development({ workflow: \"greenfield\" })\n```\n\nThe workflow will guide them through comprehensive upfront planning, making it ideal for new projects that need thorough requirements analysis, architectural design, and comprehensive documentation.\n\n**This minor enhancement is complete and ready for delivery!** 🎉\n[Tool uses: none]",

If user has supplied paths that appear to be leading to images, you should use this tool right away using Image mode. The behavior of this tool is determined by the `mode` parameter. The available modes are:\n- line: Show lines in a file, given by an optional `start_line` and optional `end_line`.\n- directory: List directory contents. Content is returned in the \"long format\" of ls (that is, `ls -la`).\n- search: Search for a pattern in a file. The pattern is a string. The matching is case insensitive.\n\nExample Usage:\n1. Read all lines from a file: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\"\n2. Read the last 5 lines from a file: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", start_line=-5\n3. List the files in the home directory: command=\"line\", path=\"~\"\n4. Recursively list files in a directory to a max depth of 2: command=\"line\", path=\"/path/to/directory\", depth=2\n5. Search for all instances of \"test\" in a file: command=\"search\", path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", pattern=\"test\"\n",
