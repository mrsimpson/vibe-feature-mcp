# End-to-End Development Workflow Integration Tests

## Feature: Complete Development Lifecycle Management

As a developer using the Vibe Feature MCP server with an LLM
I want to complete entire development workflows from initial request to project completion
So that I can build features with structured guidance and persistent progress tracking

### Background:

- End-to-end workflows span from initial feature request to completion
- Multiple tool calls and resource accesses occur throughout the workflow
- State persistence enables workflow continuation across sessions
- Plan files track progress and serve as external memory

## Scenario: Complete authentication feature development workflow

**Given** a new project directory with git repository
**When** I start a conversation about implementing user authentication
**Then** the complete workflow should progress through all phases:

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

- **Initial Request**: "I want to implement user authentication"
- **Expected**: `whats_next` creates new conversation, transitions to requirements
- **Plan File**: Created with authentication requirements template
- **Instructions**: Guide requirements gathering (auth type, user data, security)

### Phase 2: Requirements Completion

- **Context**: Requirements gathered through multiple interactions
- **Expected**: `whats_next` detects completion, suggests design transition
- **Plan File**: Updated with completed requirements tasks
- **Transition**: `proceed_to_phase` called with target "design"

### Phase 3: Design Phase

- **Context**: Technical solution design discussions
- **Expected**: Design-specific instructions for architecture and API planning
- **Plan File**: Updated with design decisions and technical specifications
- **Progress**: Database schema, API endpoints, security measures defined

### Phase 4: Implementation

- **Context**: Code implementation with LLM guidance
- **Expected**: Implementation instructions and coding best practices
- **Plan File**: Implementation tasks tracked and marked complete
- **Progress**: Authentication system built and tested

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance

- **Context**: Code review and quality validation
- **Expected**: QA instructions for testing and validation
- **Plan File**: QA checklist completed
- **Progress**: Code reviewed, requirements validated

### Phase 6: Testing

- **Context**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Expected**: Testing instructions and test plan execution
- **Plan File**: Testing tasks completed
- **Progress**: Feature fully tested and validated

### Phase 7: Completion

- **Context**: Feature complete and ready for deployment
- **Expected**: Completion instructions and project wrap-up
- **Plan File**: All tasks marked complete
- **Final State**: Conversation marked as complete

### Expected Behavior:

- Each phase should provide appropriate guidance and instructions
- Plan file should be continuously updated throughout the workflow
- State transitions should be logical and context-driven
- Progress should be preserved across multiple sessions
- Workflow should be completable from start to finish

## Scenario: Multi-session workflow continuation

**Given** a development workflow started in one session
**And** the workflow is interrupted at the design phase
**When** a new session is started later
**Then** the workflow should continue from the design phase
**And** all previous context should be preserved
**And** the plan file should reflect previous progress

### Expected Behavior:

- Server restart should not lose workflow progress
- Conversation state should be restored accurately
- Plan file should be accessible and up-to-date
- Instructions should be contextually appropriate for continuation
- No duplicate work should be required

---

## Scenario: Parallel feature development workflows

**Given** multiple feature branches in the same project
**When** different features are developed simultaneously
**Then** each branch should have isolated workflow state
**And** conversations should not interfere with each other
**And** plan files should be branch-specific when appropriate

### Expected Behavior:

- Git branch detection should create separate conversations
- Workflow states should be completely isolated
- Plan files should be managed independently
- Branch switching should load appropriate conversation context
- No cross-contamination between feature workflows

---

## Scenario: Workflow error recovery and resilience

**Given** a workflow in progress with multiple completed phases
**When** errors occur (database issues, file system problems, etc.)
**Then** the workflow should recover gracefully
**And** completed progress should be preserved
**And** the workflow should be resumable after error resolution

### Expected Behavior:

- Transient errors should not lose workflow progress
- Error recovery should restore workflow state accurately
- Plan files should remain consistent after errors
- Workflow continuation should be seamless after recovery
- Error conditions should be logged for debugging

---

## Scenario: Workflow customization and flexibility

**Given** a standard development workflow
**When** users need to customize the workflow for specific needs
**Then** phase transitions should be flexible
**And** direct phase jumps should be supported
**And** workflow adaptation should be possible

### Expected Behavior:

- Non-linear workflow progression should be supported
- Users should be able to skip or repeat phases as needed
- Workflow customization should not break state management
- Instructions should adapt to customized workflow patterns
- Plan files should reflect actual workflow progression

---

## Scenario: Complex project workflow integration

**Given** a large project with multiple interconnected features
**When** workflows span multiple related development areas
**Then** workflow management should handle project complexity
**And** feature-specific workflows should remain focused
**And** project-wide context should be maintained appropriately

### Expected Behavior:

- Complex projects should not confuse workflow management
- Feature isolation should be maintained within larger projects
- Cross-feature dependencies should be manageable
- Workflow instructions should remain focused and actionable
- Project complexity should not degrade workflow quality

---

## Scenario: Workflow completion and archival

**Given** a completed development workflow
**When** the feature is fully implemented and deployed
**Then** the workflow should be marked as complete
**And** final documentation should be generated
**And** workflow artifacts should be preserved for reference

### Expected Behavior:

- Workflow completion should be clearly marked
- Final plan files should serve as project documentation
- Completed workflows should be archivable
- Workflow history should be preserved for learning
- Completion status should be persistent and queryable

---

## Scenario: Workflow analytics and insights

**Given** multiple completed workflows
**When** analyzing development patterns and efficiency
**Then** workflow data should provide insights
**And** phase transition patterns should be analyzable
**And** workflow optimization opportunities should be identifiable

### Expected Behavior:

- Workflow data should be structured for analysis
- Phase duration and transition patterns should be trackable
- Common workflow patterns should be identifiable
- Performance metrics should be extractable
- Insights should inform workflow improvements
