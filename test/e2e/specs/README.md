- Primary analysis and instruction tool functionality
- New conversation creation and management
- Existing conversation continuation
- Context analysis and phase determination
- Error handling and parameter validation

### 03. proceed_to_phase Tool (`03-proceed-to-phase-tool.md`)

- Explicit phase transition functionality
- Valid and invalid phase transitions
- Transition reason tracking
- Concurrent transition handling
- Error scenarios and validation

### 04. Resource Access (`04-resource-access.md`)

- External tool integration

### 07. Phase Transition Engine (`07-phase-transition-engine.md`)

- Intelligent phase determination logic
- Context analysis and transition decisions
- Phase completion detection
- Regression and non-linear transitions
- Complex project context handling

### 08. End-to-End Workflows (`08-end-to-end-workflows.md`)

- Complete development lifecycle scenarios
- Multi-session workflow continuation
- Parallel feature development
- Workflow customization and flexibility
- Error recovery and resilience

## Test Approach

### BDD Style Specifications

Each test specification follows the Given-When-Then format:

- **Given**: Initial conditions and context setup
- **When**: Actions or events that trigger behavior
- **Then**: Expected outcomes and behaviors

### Expected Behavior Sections

Each scenario includes an "Expected Behavior" section that details:

- System interactions and side effects
- Data persistence and state changes
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance and reliability expectations

### Integration Focus

These tests are designed as integration tests that:

- Test complete workflows across multiple components
- Validate MCP protocol compliance
- Verify database and filesystem interactions
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery
- Test real-world usage scenarios

## Mock Strategy

The integration tests should use mocks for:

### Database Operations

- SQLite database connections and queries
- Transaction handling and rollback scenarios
- Database corruption and recovery testing
- Concurrent access simulation

### File System Operations

- Plan file creation, reading, and writing
- Directory and path resolution
- File permission and access error simulation
- External file modification detection

### Git Operations

- Branch detection and switching
- Repository state simulation
- Git command execution mocking

### MCP Protocol

- Tool call parameter validation
- Resource access request handling
- Error response formatting
- Protocol compliance verification

## Test Data Management

### Conversation States

- Various development phases and transitions
- Different project contexts and configurations
- Multiple git branch scenarios
- Historical conversation data

### Plan Files

- Template generation and customization
- Task completion tracking formats
- Various markdown structures and content
- External modification scenarios

### Project Contexts

- Different project types and structures
- Multi-feature development scenarios
- Complex project hierarchies
- Cross-project isolation testing

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these specifications:

1. **Use proper mocking frameworks** to isolate components under test
2. **Create reusable test fixtures** for common scenarios
3. **Implement setup and teardown** for clean test environments
4. **Use descriptive test names** that match scenario descriptions
5. **Validate both success and error paths** for comprehensive coverage
6. **Test edge cases and boundary conditions** identified in specifications
7. **Ensure test isolation** to prevent test interdependencies
8. **Include performance assertions** where appropriate
9. **Validate MCP protocol compliance** in all interactions
10. **Test concurrent access scenarios** for race condition detection

## Coverage Goals

These specifications aim to provide comprehensive coverage of:

- All MCP tools and resources
- Complete development workflow scenarios
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Multi-project and multi-session scenarios
- Database and filesystem operations
- Phase transition logic and context analysis
- Plan file management and synchronization
- Real-world usage patterns and edge cases

The specifications serve as both test documentation and behavioral requirements for the Vibe Feature MCP server implementation.
