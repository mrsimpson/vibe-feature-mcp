# Phase Transition Engine Integration Tests

## Feature: Intelligent Development Phase Management

As an LLM using the Vibe Feature MCP server
I want the transition engine to analyze conversation context and determine appropriate development phases
So that development workflows progress logically and efficiently

### Background:

- Transition engine analyzes conversation context, user input, and plan file status
- Engine determines when phases are complete and ready for transition
- Both automatic suggestions and explicit transitions are supported
- Engine provides contextual instructions for each phase

---

## Scenario: New feature detection and initial phase assignment

**Given** no existing conversation context
**And** user input indicates a new feature request
**When** the transition engine analyzes the context
**Then** the phase should be set to "requirements"
**And** the transition reason should indicate new feature detection
**And** instructions should guide requirements gathering

### Expected Behavior:

- New feature keywords should be detected in user input
- Initial phase assignment should be appropriate for feature development
- Transition reasoning should be clear and logical
- Instructions should be contextually relevant for starting requirements

---

## Scenario: Requirements phase completion detection

**Given** an existing conversation in "requirements" phase
**And** the plan file shows all requirements tasks completed
**And** conversation context indicates requirements gathering is done
**When** the transition engine analyzes the situation
**Then** the engine should suggest transition to "design" phase
**And** provide instructions for proceeding to design
**And** mark requirements tasks as completed

### Expected Behavior:

- Plan file analysis should detect completed requirement tasks
- Conversation context should be analyzed for completion indicators
- Phase transition suggestions should be appropriate and timely
- Task completion should be accurately identified and reported

---

## Scenario: Mid-phase continuation with incomplete tasks

**Given** an existing conversation in "design" phase
**And** the plan file shows some design tasks incomplete
**And** conversation context indicates ongoing design work
**When** the transition engine analyzes the context
**Then** the phase should remain "design"
**And** instructions should guide continuation of design work
**And** incomplete tasks should be identified

### Expected Behavior:

- Incomplete phases should not trigger premature transitions
- Instructions should focus on completing current phase work
- Task analysis should identify specific incomplete items
- Phase continuation should be handled appropriately

---

## Scenario: Context-driven phase transition analysis

**Given** rich conversation context with summary and recent messages
**And** user input indicating readiness for next phase
**When** the transition engine processes the context
**Then** conversation analysis should influence phase decisions
**And** user readiness should be factored into transitions
**And** context should provide nuanced phase determination

### Expected Behavior:

- Conversation summary should be analyzed for phase completion indicators
- Recent messages should provide immediate context for decisions
- User expressions of readiness should influence transition timing
- Context analysis should be sophisticated and nuanced

---

## Scenario: Regression to previous phases

**Given** an existing conversation in "implementation" phase
**And** conversation context indicates design issues discovered
**When** the transition engine analyzes the situation
**Then** regression to "design" phase should be suggested
**And** instructions should address the design issues
**And** the transition reason should explain the regression

### Expected Behavior:

- Backward phase transitions should be supported when appropriate
- Issue detection should trigger appropriate phase regression
- Instructions should address the specific issues that caused regression
- Transition reasoning should explain why regression is necessary

---

## Scenario: Direct phase transitions bypassing intermediate phases

**Given** an existing conversation in "requirements" phase
**And** user explicitly requests jumping to "implementation"
**When** the transition engine processes the explicit request
**Then** direct transition to "implementation" should be allowed
**And** instructions should be appropriate for implementation phase
**And** the transition should be recorded with explicit reasoning

### Expected Behavior:

- Non-sequential phase transitions should be permitted
- Explicit user requests should override normal progression
- Instructions should adapt to the target phase regardless of progression
- Transition reasoning should capture the explicit nature of the jump

---

## Scenario: Phase transition with insufficient context

**Given** minimal conversation context
**And** unclear user input about development phase
**When** the transition engine attempts analysis
**Then** conservative phase decisions should be made
**And** instructions should request clarification when needed
**And** default behavior should be safe and reasonable

### Expected Behavior:

- Insufficient context should not cause errors or crashes
- Conservative defaults should be used when context is unclear
- Clarification requests should be included in instructions when appropriate
- Fallback behavior should be predictable and helpful

---

## Scenario: Complex project context analysis

**Given** a large project with multiple features in development
**And** conversation context spanning multiple development areas
**When** the transition engine analyzes the complex context
**Then** phase determination should focus on current conversation thread
**And** instructions should be specific to the current feature
**And** context analysis should not be confused by project complexity

### Expected Behavior:

- Complex project contexts should be handled appropriately
- Current conversation focus should be maintained despite complexity
- Feature-specific analysis should be performed accurately
- Instructions should remain focused and actionable

---

## Scenario: Transition engine error handling and recovery

**Given** corrupted or invalid conversation context
**When** the transition engine attempts analysis
**Then** errors should be handled gracefully
**And** fallback phase determination should be provided
**And** error recovery should not disrupt conversation flow

### Expected Behavior:

- Invalid context should not crash the transition engine
- Error handling should provide reasonable fallback behavior
- Recovery mechanisms should maintain conversation continuity
- Error conditions should be logged for debugging purposes
