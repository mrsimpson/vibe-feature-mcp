# Plan File Management Integration Tests

## Feature: Development Plan File Operations

As an LLM using the Vibe Feature MCP server
I want plan files to be created, updated, and managed automatically
So that development progress and context are preserved across sessions

### Background:

- Plan files are markdown documents containing development tasks and progress
- Files are created automatically when conversations start
- Plan files serve as external memory for LLM conversations
- Files should be readable and editable by both server and external tools

---

## Scenario: Automatic plan file creation for new conversations

**Given** a new conversation is started for a project
**And** no existing plan file exists
**When** the conversation requires a plan file
**Then** a new plan file should be created automatically
**And** the file should contain a default template structure
**And** the file path should be stored in conversation state

### Expected Behavior:

- Plan file should be created in project directory
- Default template should include project overview and phase sections
- File name should be descriptive and feature-specific
- File creation should not overwrite existing files
- File path should be stored in database for future reference

---

## Scenario: Plan file template generation

**Given** a new plan file needs to be created
**When** the plan file is generated
**Then** it should contain standard markdown structure
**And** include sections for each development phase
**And** have placeholder content for project overview
**And** include task tracking format with checkboxes

### Expected Behavior:

- Template should follow consistent markdown format
- Phase sections should match server's development phases
- Task format should support checkbox-style completion tracking
- Template should be customizable based on project context
- Generated content should be immediately usable

---

## Scenario: Plan file content analysis for task completion

**Given** an existing plan file with tasks and checkboxes
**When** the server analyzes the plan file
**Then** completed tasks should be identified correctly
**And** incomplete tasks should be detected
**And** phase completion status should be determined
**And** task analysis should inform phase transitions

### Expected Behavior:

- Markdown checkbox parsing should work reliably
- Task completion detection should be accurate
- Phase-specific task analysis should be performed
- Completion status should influence server instructions
- Analysis should handle various markdown formats

---

## Scenario: Plan file updates and synchronization

**Given** an existing plan file
**When** development progress is made
**Then** the plan file should be updated to reflect progress
**And** completed tasks should be marked appropriately
**And** new tasks should be added as needed
**And** file modifications should be atomic

### Expected Behavior:

- File updates should preserve existing content structure
- Task completion should be marked with proper checkbox syntax
- New content should be added in appropriate sections
- File locking should prevent corruption during updates
- Updates should be reflected immediately in subsequent reads

---

## Scenario: Plan file path resolution and validation

**Given** a conversation state with a plan file path
**When** the plan file is accessed
**Then** the path should be resolved correctly relative to project
**And** the file should be accessible for reading and writing
**And** path validation should prevent security issues

### Expected Behavior:

- File paths should be resolved relative to project directory
- Path traversal attacks should be prevented
- File accessibility should be validated before operations
- Error handling should cover permission and access issues
- Paths should work across different operating systems

---

## Scenario: Plan file backup and versioning

**Given** an existing plan file with content
**When** significant updates are made
**Then** previous versions should be preserved when appropriate
**And** backup mechanisms should prevent data loss
**And** version history should be manageable

### Expected Behavior:

- Critical updates should create backup copies
- Backup files should be clearly named and dated
- Version history should not consume excessive disk space
- Recovery mechanisms should be available for corrupted files
- Backup creation should not impact performance

---

## Scenario: Plan file format validation and error handling

**Given** a plan file with potentially invalid markdown
**When** the server attempts to parse the file
**Then** parsing errors should be handled gracefully
**And** invalid content should not crash the server
**And** error recovery should attempt to preserve valid content

### Expected Behavior:

- Markdown parsing should be robust and fault-tolerant
- Invalid syntax should not cause server failures
- Error messages should be informative for debugging
- Partial content recovery should be attempted
- Fallback behavior should provide reasonable defaults

---

## Scenario: Plan file integration with external tools

**Given** a plan file created by the server
**When** external tools modify the file
**Then** the server should detect and handle external changes
**And** external modifications should not corrupt server operations
**And** file format should remain compatible with external editors

### Expected Behavior:

- External file modifications should be detected
- Server should re-read files to get latest content
- File format should be standard markdown for compatibility
- Concurrent access should be handled safely
- External changes should integrate with server's understanding

---

## Scenario: Plan file cleanup and maintenance

**Given** multiple plan files across different projects
**When** projects are completed or abandoned
**Then** cleanup mechanisms should be available
**And** orphaned plan files should be identifiable
**And** Cleanup should not affect active projects

### Expected Behavior:

- Plan file lifecycle should be manageable
- Orphaned files should be detectable and removable
- Active project files should be protected from cleanup
- Cleanup operations should be safe and reversible
- File organization should remain maintainable over time
