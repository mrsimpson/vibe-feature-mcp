<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR DESIGN DOCUMENT (COMPREHENSIVE):
- Document what to build, not how you decided to build it
- Include concrete interfaces, data models, and implementation patterns
- Focus on testing strategy and concepts, not actual test cases
- Cover error handling, security, and performance considerations
- Reference requirements that drive design decisions
- Keep technical details specific and actionable
- Link to architecture document for high-level context
-->

# Design Document

## Architecture Reference

See [Architecture Document](./architecture.md) for high-level system context and architecture decisions.

## Technology Stack

<!-- Technology choices with brief rationale -->

- **[Technology Area]:** [Choice] - [Rationale]

## Components and Interfaces

<!-- Core components, their responsibilities, and how they interact -->

### [Component Name]

- **Purpose:** [What it does]
- **Interface:** [Methods, props, events, API]
- **Implementation:** [Key patterns, state management, data flow]

## Data Models

<!-- Data structures, database schemas, API contracts, type definitions -->

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

<!-- Which aspects of the app are suitable for being tested isolated, mocking the function's interfaces -->

### Integration Testing

<!-- Which parts of the application need to be tested cross-function with mocked, defined boundaries -->

### End-to-End Testing

<!-- Which aspects need a real runtime with mocked external interfaces in order to be validated properly -->

## Error Handling

<!-- Error scenarios, recovery strategies, user experience considerations -->

## Security Considerations

<!-- Security requirements, validation approaches, authentication patterns -->

## Performance Optimizations

<!-- Performance goals, optimization strategies, monitoring approaches -->
